# Launchpad

## What is Launchpad?
Launchpad is the ideal scaffolding to start a new project. The repository is a monorepo with an api, contract and placeholder for react (frontend) application.
We are required to use this app as starter for any projects as it provides a good default for API, writing Contracts,
CI/CD (CircleCI) & deployment.

## Features:

- Contracts and contract deployment
- Basic api structure to start from
- A place holder for react app to be added on(with e2e test already setup)
- Continuous Integration (Full CircleCI configuration to check contract, api and react)
- Parity backup and restore *(uses Amazon S3)*
- Sentry integration for Error Monitoring (Optional)
- Elasticsearch integration (Optional)
- CLI to create project
- Docker for development
- Docker swarm deployment

## Directories

- [Webapp](./react) - Placeholder for Front-end React application
- [API](./api) - Node.js API
- [Contracts](./contracts) - Ethereum Solidity contracts
- [Docs](./docs) - Documentation, guides, notes, etc
- [stack](./stack) - Docker environments - Dev and Swarm --- Dev - Development environment with hot reload for the api and react -- Swarm - Local Staging (no code reloading) and Swarm environment (environment for swarm and kubernetes deployments)
- [CLI](./cli) - Launchpad CLI to create base app quickly

#### Stack:

Other than the Dev and Swarm stacks we have:

- [parity](./stack/parity) - Parity Ethereum - configurations for the Ethereum nodes deployed in the swarm - Remember to regenerate the private keys and to make sure volumes are backed up (private-chain deployments - TODO need a documentation section )
- [backup](./stack/backup) - Parity S3 Backup cronjob
- [explorer](./stack/explorer) - AB block explorer settings
- [sentry](./stack/sentry) - Sentry - exception notification (see readme)
- [logging](./stack/logging) - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana enterprise logging stack
- [monitoring](./stack/monitoring) - Prometheus / Grafana enterprise monitoring stack



## How to develop

### Local Setup with Docker (recommended)
To run the project locally you will require `docker` and `docker-compose`.

1. Cd into `stack`
2. Run `source docker-aliases.sh`
4. Start parity only: `launchpad-compose up parity`
5. While parity is running, deploy the contracts(run `npm run compile && npm run deploy` from the contracts folder, You might need to run `npm i && npm run compile` if you haven't already).
6. Run `launchpad-compose build` to build the images
7. Stop parity and run `launchpad-compose up` to start all the services

### Local setup without docker

1. [Running **Ethereum Blockchain** node locally](https://github.com/appliedblockchain/launchpad/tree/master/api#run-blockchain-network-and-contract-deployment)

  **Options**
  * [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache)
  * [Parity](https://wiki.parity.io/Setup)
  * [Geth](https://ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/content/getting_a_client.html)


2. [Compile and deploy Contracts](https://github.com/appliedblockchain/launchpad/tree/master/api#run-blockchain-network-and-contract-deployment)

  Solidity Contract required to be compiled and deployed onto blockchain.

3. [Running API](https://github.com/appliedblockchain/launchpad/tree/master/api#run-blockchain-network-and-contract-deployment)

4. [Running react application (WebApp)](https://github.com/appliedblockchain/launchpad/tree/master/react#getting-started)


### Run this app with Docker Staging

`docker-compose up --build`

### Restart API:

`docker-compose up --build api` (in a separate SH)


#### Restart API redeploying contracts:

    docker-compose down -v api && docker-compose up --build api
