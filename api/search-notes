- for insertion into ES:
  - generate a mnemonic locally and store it in the config (this is the servers mnemonic)
  - store the public key in the config of the clinet

  - in the client, when we add a new note, add the public key to the list of public keys
  
  - add mantle to setupweb3 in server so it's available in addNote and getNote
  - in addNote, check event is successful, then getNote and decrypt using mantle.decrypt using the mnemonic in the config, then store it in ES
  

- for search
  - in client, sign the search so we know it's coming from you, tag:$query,encryptedText:$query
  - in the backend, append the !address:ADDRESS and the whole thing becomes a query string for advance search
  - will only return if you have access to the note
